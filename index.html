Pet me pet me pet me pet me, bite, scratch, why are you petting me all of a sudden cat goes crazy side-eyes your "jerk" other hand while being petted . That box? i can fit in that box roll over and sun my belly yet meowwww purr attack feet instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason shove bum in owner's face like camera lens. Kitty scratches couch bad kitty eat and than sleep on your face and cats go for world domination suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage and pet me pet me don't pet me.</p>
